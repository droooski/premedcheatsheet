                <p>My name is _____, and I'm a ______ student at ______ University. I'm also a jumper on the track and field team at ______, and that is one of the reasons that has led to my interest in orthopedics and specifically foot and ankle. I have been following the work you have done on ________ and found it extremely interesting. I was wondering if you had any open positions to work with you this summer?</p>
                <br />
                <p>I currently conduct orthopedic research under _____ at ______. I am involved with two projects: one investigating the phosphocreatine recovery in the lower extremity of heart-failure patients and one involving characterization of fixation times of knee cartilage and meniscus by ultra-high resolution 7T MRI segmentations. I have finished a retrospective pathological femur fixation project with Dr. _____ at University Hospitals in the past.</p>
                <br />
                <p>This past summer I was awarded the NIH Director's Award, and I have a couple abstract publications and several poster presentations with one at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I have attached my CV below. If you are available, would it be possible to discuss possible research opportunities? Feel free to contact me through this email, my phone number: ______, or an online meeting. It would be a wonderful opportunity to contribute to research with you.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Hello! I hope you are doing well! My name is _____, and I am a current _____ undergraduate studying at ______ University. I am majoring in biomedical engineering with an intended specialty in biomaterials. I have attached my CV to this email for reference. I am highly interested in the field of tissue regeneration and engineering.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Reading your paper titled "____________" has solidified my fascination for tissue engineering. I was amazed at how your lab, despite the native resistance in the experimental cells, was able to successfully herd cell populations into complex maneuvers using a programmable electro-bioreactor. As mentioned in the paper, the applications of this research extend into areas such as wound healing and morphogenesis, and I am very interested to learn more.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I understand that you are extremely busy, but would it be possible for you to take some time to talk with me about your research and to answer some questions I have in regards to your work?</p>
                <br />
                <p>PS: I never knew the history of rhinoplasty could be so morbid yet so intriguing until I listened to your _____ Talk.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
